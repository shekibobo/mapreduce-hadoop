Twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky
twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are

When the blazing sun is gone
when she nothing shines upon
then you show your little light
twinkle twinkle all the night
twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are

When the traveler in the dark
thanks you for your tiny spark
would she know which way to go
if you did not twinkle so
twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are

In the dark blue sky you keep
and often through my curtains peek
for you never shut your eye
till the sun is in the sky
twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are
